  <h2>About</h2>
  <strong>A lot can happen when we bring together government officials, city managers, technologists, area experts, and open data evangelists.</strong>
  <p>Conversations get started. Best practices are gleaned. Challenges are discussed.</p>
  <p>The Open Data Roadshow began at the Inland Empire Data Forum, co-hosted with California Forward. Code for America embarked on an open data journey (<a href="https://twitter.com/#opendatavan">#opendatavan</a>) from San Francisco to Riverside, CA to present an exciting day of open data panels, presentations, and workshops. 
   <p> The successful event has inspired the Open Data Roadshow.</p>
  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Bringing the best of open data practices, policies and experiences to cities.</li>
    <li>Educating a government audience to the concept, values, and opportunities of open data.</li>
    <li>Consulting and troubleshooting how government staff can pursue open data within their own agencies.</li>
    <li>Sharing resources and  best practices to support governments interested in implementing open data.</li>
  </ul>
